# Find Handlers

The find handlers script is a Binary Ninja scripts that seaches a directory of binaries (/nova/bin ideally) for addHandler calls. It then spits out the handler numbers for each binary. This helps us figure out the attack surface for a given binary.

## Dependencies

This is a binary ninja script. So it relies on binary ninja's API / tooling.

## Usage Example

```sh
albinolobster$ python find_handlers.py ~/Desktop/6_41_4/nova/bin/ 2> /dev/null
